This is a small project I came up with to practice writing some React.

Ideas for additional features:
-Add all of the other Stardew Valley characters
-Sort functionality (sort by birthday season or gender)
-Add a search section that returns a list of characters that have a match to any of their arrays
-Add a better way to display the loves/likes/hates using pixel art of each item
